# TakeusonaJourney

Hello everyone!
The following code has been written for a school project called "TakeUsOnAjourney", trying to create a miniwebsite of a travel agency.

We used HTML5,PHP7,CSS3, JS(ES 12) and there are frames from the library JQuery. 

Most part of the codes are not completed because it was my first time using these languages, so whoever wants can add some changes and improve it.
